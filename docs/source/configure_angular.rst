Configure the Angular App
--------------------------------

There are a few things we need to setup before we can build the
rest of the application.  We need to add the Stormpath modules as
dependencies of our application, and we need to configure some of the
magic that will happen with the `UI Router`_ module.

Add Stormpath to the Angular Application
==========================================

We need to manually declare the Stormpath Angular SDK as a module
in the Angular app.

Open the file ``client/app/app.js`` and modify the module list
to look like so::

    angular.module('dashboardAppApp', [
      'ngCookies',
      'ngResource',
      'ngSanitize',
      'ui.router',
      'stormpath',
      'stormpath.templates'
    ])

Configure the UI Router Integration
===================================

You're going to get the best bang for your buck if you use the
`UI Router`_ module: it's amazing.  So much so that we've built a
special integration for it.

In the same ``app.js`` file you want to add this run block, place
it below the ``.config`` block (make sure you move the semicolon
from the config block to the run block)::


    .run(function($stormpath){
      $stormpath.uiRouter({
        loginState: 'login',
        defaultPostLoginState: 'main'
      });
    });

This tells the integration to do the following:

* Redirect users to the ``login`` view if they try to access a restricted view. After login, they are sent back to the view that they originally requested.
* Send users to the ``main`` view after login, if they have visited the login page directly (they did not try to access a restricted view first).

With that, we can move to the next section and create a Registration Form, so that
users can sign up for our service.
