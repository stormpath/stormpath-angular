Secure the API
====================

The project generator created a simple API for us. It is an Express.js application.
It serves a list of things at ``/api/things`` (you saw this when you ran ``grunt serve`` for the first time,
they were listed on the home page of the application).  We will use Stormpath to secure this simple API

Configure Your Environment Variables
------------------------------------

In the last section, :ref:`create_tenant`, we gathered our API keys an Application href.

We need to place this information somewhere, so that our Express server can make use of it
This generator follows a convention: whatever is listed in ``server/config/local.env.js`` will
be automatically exposed to the environment.  Open that file, add these properties to the
export block, and fill in your values::

    module.exports = {
      DOMAIN: 'http://localhost:9000',
      SESSION_SECRET: "dashboard-secret",
      // Control debug level for modules using visionmedia/debug
      DEBUG: '',
      STORMPATH_API_KEY_ID: 'YOUR_KEY_ID',
      STORMPATH_API_KEY_SECRET: 'YOUR_KEY_SECRET',
      STORMPATH_APP_HREF: 'YOUR_APP_HREF'
    };

Grunt will automatically export these values to the environment, and the Stormpath SDK will pick them up automatically.


Add the Stormpath Middleware
---------------------------

Find the file ``server/routes.js``.

This file is attaching some routes to the Express application that is setup in ``server/app.js``.

We want to initialize the Stormpath middleware and add it before our API declaration, so that the API will be automatically protected.

First things first, you need to require the SDK - place this at the top of the file::

    var stormpathExpressSdk = require('stormpath-sdk-express');

Then you want to create an instance of the Stormpath middleware.  You can
pass options, but in our case, we are just going to make a simple call and
use all the default options.  Add this line before the ``module.exports`` statement::

    var spMiddleware = stormpathExpressSdk.createMiddleware();

Then inside the module.exports, before any other `app` statements::

    spMiddleware.attachDefaults(app);

This will attach the following route handlers to your Express app:

* ``POST /oauth/token`` (accepts the login form POST, returns an access token)
* ``POST /api/users`` (for creating new users)
* ``GET /api/users/current`` (for getting info about the current user, as permitted by the access token)
* ``GET /logout`` (for ending the current session, the access token is destroyed)

The last thing we need to do is secure the things endpoint.  Modify that line
to use the authenticate middleware::

    app.use('/api/things', spMiddleware.authenticate, require('./api/thing'));

Reload the App
---------------

Restart the server by running ``grunt serve`` again.  You should now see that
the features are no longer listed - this is because the endpoint fails to load
with a ``401 Unauthorized`` - you can see this by looking inside the web console
in your browser:

Our API is now protected from unauthorized, anonymous access.  In the next two sections, we will show you how to create a registration form and a login form.  At that point, you will be able to login and have access to the API.
